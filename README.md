# FedBlock: Biomedical Federated Learning with Blockchain Audit

FedBlock is an open-source framework specialized for **biomedical data analysis** using privacy-preserving federated learning with immutable blockchain audit logging. It enables healthcare institutions and research organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models on sensitive health data without sharing raw patient information, while maintaining complete transparency through blockchain-based audit trails.

## üè• Biomedical Focus

FedBlock is specifically designed for health-related analytics and statistical modeling:

- **Privacy-Preserving Health Analytics**: Train models on sensitive patient data without data leaving clinical sites
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in audit logging for HIPAA, GDPR, and clinical research compliance  
- **Multi-Modal Health Data**: Support for clinical records, medical imaging, wearable devices, and genomic data
- **Statistical Analysis**: Advanced regression models and correlation analysis for biomedical research

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

chmod +x setup_biomedical.sh
./setup_biomedical.sh
```

### Manual Setup

1. **Setup Python Environment**:
```bash
python -m venv fedblock_env
source fedblock_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fedblock_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Setup Blockchain Environment** (optional):
```bash
cd blockchain
npm install

### Starting the Platform

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Windows
start_fedblock.bat

# Linux/MacOS  
./start_fedblock.sh
```

**Manual Start**:
```bash
# Start the orchestration server
cd server
python -m flask run --host=localhost --port=5000

# In another terminal, start a Python client
cd client
export CLIENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001

python -m flask run --port 5001
```

### Running Biomedical Analysis

Once the platform is running, you can start federated learning for various biomedical tasks:

```python
# Example: Start cardiovascular risk assessment
import requests

server_url = "http://localhost:5000"
requests.post(f"{server_url}/training", json={
    "training_type": "CARDIOVASCULAR_RISK",
    "epochs": 50,
    "learning_rate": 0.001
})
```

### Android Client Setup

1. **Open Android Studio**:
```bash
cd client-android
# Open this directory in Android Studio
```

2. **Build and Install**:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# Install the generated APK on your Android device
```

3. **Configure Connection**:
   - Set server URL in the app settings
   - Ensure your device is on the same network as the server
