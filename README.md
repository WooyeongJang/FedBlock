# FedBlock: Biomedical Federated Learning with Blockchain Audit

FedBlock is an open-source framework specialized for **biomedical data analysis** using privacy-preserving federated learning with immutable blockchain audit logging. It enables healthcare institutions and research organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models on sensitive health data without sharing raw patient information, while maintaining complete transparency through blockchain-based audit trails.

## üè• Biomedical Focus

FedBlock is specifically designed for health-related analytics and statistical modeling:

- **Privacy-Preserving Health Analytics**: Train models on sensitive patient data without data leaving clinical sites
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in audit logging for HIPAA, GDPR, and clinical research compliance  
- **Multi-Modal Health Data**: Support for clinical records, medical imaging, wearable devices, and genomic data
- **Statistical Analysis**: Advanced regression models and correlation analysis for biomedical research

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Python Client** (`client/`): Python-based federated learning participants
- **Android Client** (`client-android/`): Mobile federated learning client with native UI
